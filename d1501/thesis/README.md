# Thesis
## Content
Your thesis should describe clearly the subject of the thesis, the applied methods, results and the conclusions. As a basic component of your work the writing may take a quarter of your time.
The structure as given in the template below is:

- Cover sheet including institute, name of the student and the adviser, number and title of the thesis in German and English, the official date of receiving the topic and the date of delivering the final work
- Table of contents
- Summary of used symbols
- Main part
  - Introduction to the subject and working environment
  - Theoretical foundations and applied methods
  - Presentation of results
  - Discussion of results
  - Summary of results and outlook
- Appendix
- References
- Declaration

Note: if you plan to submit your thesis in English, keep in mind that the exam regulations of most study programs require you to include a German summary. This is the case in the following programs: Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik (B.Sc. and M.Sc.), M.Sc. Elektromobilit√§t, M.Sc. Nachhaltige Elektrische Energieversorgung, B.Sc. Medizintechnik, B.Sc. Mechatronik, Informatik (B.Sc. and M.Sc.). The following programs include a regulation for a mandatory German summary in their master thesis, but no regulation for the study thesis: M.Sc. Medizintechnik, M.Sc. Mechatronik. Similarly, if you study in one of the English programs Infotech, Electrical Engineering or Computer Science, it is mandatory to include an English summary if your thesis is submitted in any language other than English. If you study in another program that is not listed here, please refer to the exam regulations of your study program!

## "How many pages should I write?"
First of all: The content is more important than the number of pages.

Our guideline for the number of pages of the main part (i.e. without the titel page, table of contents, list of tables / figures, references,  appendices, ...) is:

- Bachelor thesis: 30 to 60 pages
- Forschungsarbeit: 40 to 80 pages
- Master thesis: 50 to 100 pages

We recommend talking to your adviser, if the length of your thesis is outside of the proposed range.

## Plagiarism guidlines
Plagiarism is a serious violation of exam regulations and scientific ethics. If your supervisor finds plagiarized parts in your thesis, this may lead to a deduction from your grade or failing your thesis (i.e. getting a 5.0), depending on the degree of plagiarism. As a violation involving plagiarism can even lead to your Bachelor's or Master's degree being revoked if it is found after you graduate, please make sure that you take notice of this pdf concerning plagiarism guidlines of the University before you start writing your thesis!
