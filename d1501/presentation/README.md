# Presentation
- The presentation is held during the colloquium in front of the professor, the assistants and other students and is followed by questions from the audience.
- The exam regulations (Pr√ºfungsordnungen B.Sc. und M.Sc. Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik) state time limits for the oral presentation. Exceeding these limits will result in a lowered grade!
  - Bachelor thesis: 20-30 min.
  - Forschungsarbeit: 20-30 min.
  - Master thesis: 20-40 min.
- Our general recommendation for the duration of all talks is 20 min.
- Make sure that your slides are structured clearly following these [hints](https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto.php?target=wiki_449273_hints_on_presentation).
- We suggest you to make a trial presentation with your adviser some days in advance.
- There is a computer installed with the necessary programs. In case you want to use your own laptop, you must check the compatibility in advance.
